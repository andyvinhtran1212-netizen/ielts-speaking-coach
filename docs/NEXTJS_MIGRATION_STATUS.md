# Next.js migration status contract

The migration is not complete merely because a clean URL has an App Router
page. Final closure still requires the full Gate D/E/F evidence in
`FE_NEXTJS_MIGRATION_MASTER_PLAN_2026-07-12.md`.

The repository-side denominator is generated from canonical code sources:

```bash
cd frontend
node tooling/next-migration-status.mjs
node tooling/next-migration-status.mjs --json
```

The report counts:

- product `app/**/page.tsx` routes, excluding the two named engineering spikes;
- every `public/**/*.html` artifact, split into compatibility redirects and
  HTML paths still directly rendered by production;
- a canonical App Router replacement and domain owner for every directly
  renderable HTML path;
- route-ownership collisions;
- Next readiness and live new-session admission for every core player.

`--assert-static-complete` is the final code-cutover gate. It intentionally
fails while any legacy HTML is directly renderable, any HTML lacks an App
Router replacement, any core Next player is not ready, any core surface still
admits new sessions to legacy, or any route ownership collision exists.

Current replacement denominator: 119/121. The two explicit gaps are `/exam`
and `/mock-exam`; the report must keep
`legacy-next-replacement-missing` non-zero until behavior-equivalent App Router
owners exist. A nearby landing page is not a valid replacement for a player.

This static gate does not replace Preview/staging, persistence, failure-mode,
device, accessibility, performance, rollback, drain or soak evidence. Those
operational gates must also be closed before the migration can be called done.
